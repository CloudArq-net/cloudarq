# 05 — an owner id that the pattern does not close

**Expected.** `OwnerIDNotClosed` → **outsider**, exact: the owner `acme`, pinned by name, recyclable.

**Why.** `repo:acme@123*` closes the name with `@` and then runs into the id without reaching the
`/` that ends it: `acme@1234567` matches as well as `acme@123456`. The deepest part closed is the
name, so the pin is by name and recyclable; the id pins nothing.
